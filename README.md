This application utilizes Ruby 2.5.3, Rails 6.0.0, Amazon Web Services. 

At the Home Page, the user can navigate to the "Sign In" or "Sign Up" to create a profile. A modal will appear, where the user can create an account or sign in powered by the Devise gem.

From here, the user can create a new post in the navbar link, which will make another form appear. This form requires a name, address, and description. Once the new place is created, the user can add a photo. 

The user can navigate to the other spots on the homepage, and from there click a spot and submit a comment and rating, or submit a photo of their own. 

The user also has a profile page, where they can see all of the places they've commented on, rated and created.
